# CS210

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
  This project was created to make a 12 hour and 24 hour clock for a fictional company called "Chada Tech." They asked for both 12 and 24 hour clocks to be displayed and for the use
  of user input to change the clocks to specific times.
- What did you do particularly well?
  I found that I was easily able to pick up C++ coding because of my experience in 2 other classes with other coding languages. I also was able to use true object oriented programming
  by creating a "clock" object and a separate "main" class.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I felt my code was very efficient and well organized. I don't think there was anywhere I could've improved on this particular project.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The clock.cpp portion is what I had the hardest time with. There were so many subtle formatting issues that needed to be addressed by the prompt. To help, I consulted my partner's cousin's partner
  who is also in the industry and he got me through the tought portions.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  C++ is now my preffered language and I think learning about how C++ is used for certain projects, while python is used for others, etc. will help me to utilitize all of these languages
  to their fullest potential.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I'm big on formatting my code, using spaces where nessecary, to almost feel like thoughts that are similar and grouped together. It also helps with readability to also leave many
  in-line comments.
